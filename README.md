# PigmentationModel
Simulation code for the paper "The impact of environmental fluctuations, sexual dimorphism, dominance reversal and plasticity on the pigmentation-related genetic and phenotypic variation in *D. melanogaster* populations â€“ A modelling study."

Python code to simulate the stochastic population model introduced and used in the article. 
Inputs of the function model_dim2_2locus are the following:

**family=** dataframe with 7 columns, representing the entire population, with each row corresponding to an individual: 

    Locus_1: determines the version of the pigmentation gene in the individual (AA, Aa, or aa).
    
    Locus_2: sex of the individual (XX for females and XY for males).
    
    Pigmentation: pigmentation of the individual.
    
    X: first coordinate of the individual in the geographical span of the population.
    
    Y: second coordinate of the individual in the geographical span of the population.
    
    Birth: date of birth of the individual.
    
    Death: date of death of the individual, if the value is -1 then the individual is alive.

**C_delta_delta=** positive constant giving an upper-bound on the sum of the birth rates plus the death rate for any female individual. This constant has to be determined by the user, based on the functions encoding the reproduction and death rates. It is chosen in such a way that "sum of the rates < C_delta_delta(1 + population size)". This inequality is obtained by bounding each birth rate and summing each of these upper bounds. Then, we find a constant mu such that "death_rate(..., population size, ...)" < mu(1 + population size). Finally, we set C_delta_delta = sum of the upper bounds + mu.

**time=** end time of the simulation (in "days", the time unit in the model)

**h=** time step (in model time units)

**delta_1=** positive number describing the interaction range for death by competition

**delta_2=** positive number describing the interaction range for the reproduction kernel

**alpha,beta=** the spatial locations of individuals take their values in [-alpha, alpha] x [-beta, beta]

**m=** diffusion coefficient (or variance) of the individual Brownian motion

**periode=** period of the temperature function

**lamb=** average total number of offspring of a female during a single reproduction event

**a=** coefficient regulating the adaptation of dark phenotypes

**b=** coefficient regulating the adaptation of light phenotypes

**c=** coefficient regulating the mortality rate

**constante_vieillesse=** coefficient describing the effect of natural death within the population

**nb_competition=** coefficient describing the effect of death due to competition 

The code outputs two dataframes: **family** and **data_graph**. Family is of the same nature as the dataframe passed as input to the function. Data_graph is a dataframe with 7 columns that contains the sizes of the 7 sub-populations in the model. Each row i represents the size of the subpopulations at time i*h days.
